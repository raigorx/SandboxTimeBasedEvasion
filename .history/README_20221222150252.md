## Why?

I though was fun to do some necromancy to an old code on the way I found that it doesnt work anymore so I read the code and did some debug to make it works

## How to Build/Compile original code

Visual studio 2022 and its workload Desktop development with C++ are requiere

Open the .sln file with visual studio and let it upgrade the solution. Build the solution as usual. That is, no adictional fix are require

## Code structure

- **nthookengine_original** contain the original code without modifications found on Powerful x86/x64 Mini Hook-Engine
- **nthookengine_modified** code upgrade to vs-studio 2022 with binaries built on this version

## The bug and fix
There is a miss calculation on the code size to disam so I changed it [View Fix](https://github.com/raigorx/nthookengine/commit/48620a98161842677a7ca59bec9e2c6e4f576e64)
